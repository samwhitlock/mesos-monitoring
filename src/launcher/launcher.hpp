// standalone program (with the main function in launcher_main.cpp).
//
// The environment is initialized through for steps:
// 1) A work directory for the framework is created by createWorkingDirectory().
// 2) The executor is fetched off HDFS if necessary by fetchExecutor().
// 3) Environment variables are set by setupEnvironment().
// 4) We switch to the framework's user in switchUser().
//
// Isolation modules that wish to override the default behaviour can subclass
// Launcher and override some of the methods to perform extra actions.
